# Source Code Management - Git

Check [Git stuff](https://github.com/mattpe/git-intro/blob/master/git-basics.md)

What files to include in repo?

- all source code
- README.md and other documentation
- eg. npm grunt or bower settings files
- .gitignore file: list of local stuff not to be included in the version control ->

Exclude:

- IDE specific project files & folders (.idea)
- build targets and other automatically generated files
- packages managed e.g. by npm or bower (= _node_modules/_ & _bower_components/_ folders) 
- any temp & OS specific files, like Apple's `.DS_Store` 

Create React App generates a .gitignore file automatically. Add .idea manually.

# Package Management

## [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node.js Package Manager

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to get the package manager **npm**
- npm packages needed in a project (dependencies) are listed in the `package.json` file and can be install with `npm install` command
- locally installed (=project specific) packages are downloaded to `node_modules/` folder (should be excluded from version control)

#### OS X no sudo

- [instructions](https://johnpapa.net/node-and-npm-without-sudo/)

#### NPM Alternative

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 

- newcomer gaining a lot of traction now
- first [open source release on October, 2016](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360). Current version 0.18.1 
- uses same package.json file and npm registry as npm
- claimed to be faster, more secure and reliable

# Example package.json

```javascript
{
  "name": "example-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "author": "Example Coder <ecoder@example.com>",
  "description": "An example app doing something",
  "license": "MIT",
